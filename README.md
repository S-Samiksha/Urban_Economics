### Urban Economics Project

This project was taken as part of the HE3613 Urban Economics Course. While the main aspect of this project was to focus on finding factors that affect HDB Resale Prices in Singapore, our group decided to explore further and use machine learning techniques to predic the HDB resale prices. 

##### Aim
With the introduction of new urban planning policies and the rising rate of housing ownership, it is essential to understand how housing prices in Singapore are affected by such changes. This study aims to investigate theoretical factors, such as distance of a HDB flat from the central business district (CBD) and floor area of the house, on housing resale prices. From here on, when we refer to prices, it refers to HDB resale prices. Furthermore, it aims to analyze additional factors such as distance from Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and remaining lease period and how it affects the prices. 

#### Data Cleaning 
Most of the Data Cleaning was done using Python3 and the codes are available in this repository.
